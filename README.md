### About Me

```
function rgb(r, g, b) {
  r = Math.max(Math.min(r, 255), 0);
  g = Math.max(Math.min(g, 255), 0);
  b = Math.max(Math.min(b, 255), 0);
  
  r = r.toString(16).padStart(2,'0');
  g = g.toString(16).padStart(2,'0');
  b = b.toString(16).padStart(2,'0');
  
  return (r + g + b).toUpperCase(); 
}
```

# Hi!
### Hello

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

<!-- A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].   -->

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.

> This is first line <br>

This is _second one_ <br>

This is **third one** <br>
~~Mistaken~~
Use `git status` to list all new or modified `files` that haven't yet been committed.<br>

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status 
git add
git commit
```

dkfjaskjvn
```
getElementById('name')
<div></div>
```
